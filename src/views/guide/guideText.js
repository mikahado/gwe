      <p>Welcome to the Global W.E./Global Warming Express Online Curriculum Guide</p>,
      <p>As you can see, the Online Curriculum includes books (written and spoken) and discussions about the books (also written and spoken). Each class or lesson is called a Session. Why Session? The word session is a little less like lesson or class. Although we may be joining your class or lesson, and although we cover a good deal of science, history and geography, we’d like your students to associate this content with a break from academics.</p>,
      <p>Here are some tips for playing the books and the discussions:</p>

      <li>Play each book twice.</li>,
      <li>
        Play once, straight through, with the narrator reading aloud
        and the students following by listening or reading along.
      </li>,
      <li>
        For the second time, try not playing the narration and simply
        let the students take turns reading. This will take longer, but
        it will give the students a chance to practice their skills with
        reading aloud. It also will enable the students to review the
        material and to understand it more kinesthetically, while they
        read it, themselves.
      </li>,
      <li>
        Pause the reading often. Focus on the illustrations and bring
        in questions about the images. A good deal of explanation can
        occur when you and the students are investigating the pictures.
        The same goes for the text. Pause to explain new words and new
        concepts. Allow the students to try to explain, first, and you
        can embellish their explanations (no matter how short ot how
        incorrect) into explanation of the material. Keep them engaged
        with questions, throughout.
      </li>,
      <li>
        Note: For <u>The Sunlight Series</u> books, be sure to
        introduce the word “photon” and its explanation. Once the
        students really understand what photons are, challenge them to
        find the photons in each book. They will soon see that the
        photons fill each book!
      </li>,
      <li>
        For the <u>Rivers of Sunlight</u> book, which deals with the
        ocean, if your students do not have experience of the ocean, try
        sharing one or both of the BBC’s excellent <i>Blue Planet</i>{' '}
        and <i>Blue Planet II</i> films before you read the book!

        <li>Play each section twice</li>,

          Play once, straight through, with the narrator reading aloud

          This book obviously lends itself to having the students take
          different roles for the out-loud reading.
        </li>,
        <li>
          You might want to ask the students to read the book in
          sections, or all at once, at home. Many students are drawn to
          the book, as it was written by a kid their age, and they like to
          read it on their own.
        </li>,
        <li>
          Letting the students take their time in discussions about the
          book help them to not only learn the science within it, but
          inspires them to think about their own creative processes. We
          have found that this book has inspired students to draw, paint,
          collage, create arts and crafts, write and perform songs, dances
          and plays, and to make their own short films about their
          response to the book.

          Pause the reading often, in order to explain new words and new
          concepts. Allow the students to try to explain, first, and then
          you can embellish their explanations (no matter how short ot how

        </li>,
        <li>
          The Discussions also lend themselves to creating a play out of
          them. Allow the students to take different characters and to
          voice them. The students may even want to create their own plays
          based upon these portrayals.

          Note that, in the <i>Greenhouse Gas Discussion</i>, there is an
          experiential aspect for the students. If you are teaching in a
          live classroom, consider bringing in sheets and large beach
          towels or blankets. (For a detailed explanation of how you might
          run this experience, refer to Session 1 in the GWE Curriculum,
          also on the website)

          Note that Photons make their appearance, again, in one of the
          Discussions. You can challenge your students to find that image!

        All of the materials we use lend themselves to students’
        imaginations. While you present the GWE Online Curriculum App,
        it’s best to take your time. Intersperse your teaching with
        activities, both indoors and outdoors, games, play and creative
        outlets, such as song, dance, puppet shows, plays, drawing,
        painting, murals and movies. We have found that any facts may be
        taught by means of Creative Drama. Creative Drama grounds the
        material in the students’ kinesthetic awareness by being
        experienced through their bodies.
